                <br>Comm. Sq. support for our bldg. 222 was outstanding -


                <br><br>
                SSgt Collins and KST (SCOIT) not only making sure our network drops were run ahead of schedule but also making sure updates for our DTS VoIP numbers were accomplished as well.  The VoIP changes for DTS was a last minute request to prevent x3778 from ringing in bldg. 29.  This helped us get FMF and DTS back up and running without issues.


                <br><br>
                SrA Donnelly (SCOI) helping us get our network drops in bldg. 222 activated on-time despite running into an issue with the last remaining 11 ports.  Not only did he resolve our issue but he also helped out FSS as well.  Also, SrA Donnelly and SrA Price (SCOI) helping us resolve multiple port security lock outs as we were moving people, network connectivity issue, and making sure our printers were on the correct VLAN.  They had us up and running in only a couple of hours.


                <br><br>
                FMF re-opened on Monday fully operational.  They really took care of us and their response time to all our issues was amazing.

                <div><h3 style="display: inline;">Project Title:</h3> Base Telecommunication System (BTS) Services</div>

                <h3>Contract Effort Description</h3>

telephone system switch, the outside plant (OSP) and inside plant (ISP) systems, network, and

equipment and systems (see end of paragraph), which may include other systems (e.g., Voice
over Internet Protocol (VoIP), etc.) in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) technical manuals and specifications, Department of Defense (DoD) and
US Air Force (AF) policy and regulations, applicable federal, state and local laws and

              <br><br>
              <h3>Assessing Official Comments:</h3>
              <br>
              <div><h4 style="display: inline;">Quality:</h4> Ka&#39;ala Systems Technology (KST) has gone above and beyond to provide
exceptional work to Holloman AFB users and its tenant units. On multiple occasions the 49th
Communications Squadron have received official correspondence from other agencies
complimenting KST&#39;s quality and timeliness, to include but not limited to the 49 th MDG, 49th
FSS, 49th LRS, and 54th FG. The 49th Communications Squadron and COR have received zero
complaints from users on any of KST&#39;s work. When the new Medical Clinic (building 23) was
built on HAFB, KST noted and briefed 49 CS/SCXP and the COR that a medical building
(building 17) would lose connectivity from the old site (building 15). When brought to the
attention of the 49th MDG personnel, they stated that building 17 would no longer be used. After
the move in date for building 23 was passed, 49th MDG realized the clinic did not have enough
space for all personnel and had to move Family Health to building 17. Due to the demolition of
building 15, building 17 had lost all network connectivity and Family Health was effectively
closed. Within three days of total outage, KST was able to provide the 49th MDG with a no-cost
solution to restore connectivity to the building while awaiting funding for the permanent circuit
project. Without KST&#39;s quick intervention, Family Health and building 17 would have been
completely cut off from the network for a minimum of 21 days.</div>
<br>
              <div><h4 style="display: inline;">Schedule:</h4> Ka&#39;ala Systems Technology (KST) has met or exceeded all Period of Performance
(PoP) as outlined in the contract in an extremely timely manner. KST completes all work orders
IAW the Performance Work Statement (PWS) well under the time allowed for each category
requirement. For example, 49th FSS MPF functions had to relocate for building renovations.
Despite paying for their work order late, KST was able to relocate all the MPF functions over a
week earlier than the customer expected and two weeks before their PoP, resulting in little to no
loss of MPF services for HAFB personnel. Additionally, when the 49th MDG personnel moved
to buildings 23 and building 17 from the old clinic building 15, KST was able to complete all
work orders nearly a month in advance of their PoP to facilitate a 49th WG move-in- date for the
new clinic. Some of these outstanding scheduling performances would not have been possible
without KST&#39;s willingness to provide a $10K back stock of materials not required in the contract
to help meet HAFB customer requirements and emergencies. Digging permits were all processed
in a timely manner. A review by the QA of monthly, quarterly, semi-annual deliverables and
monthly Preventative Maintenance Inspections (PMIs) did not reveal any discrepancies.
Contractor met all required timelines for submittal of work center records (deliverables). Work
center records to include traffic study, spare pair test results, maintenance/repair logs, etc., are
submitted IAW the PWS and are available to the COR for review at any time. Routine Trouble
Tickets are completed by the close of business the same day the tickets are tasked to KST, and
all billable repairs were completed earlier than their PoP. BTS invoices are always submitted to
the COR within the allotted timeframe.</div>
              <br>
              <div><h4 style="display: inline;">Cost Control:</h4> The contract is firm fixed price, with hundreds of pre-priced product
identifications (PIDs) on the Purchase, Installation, Relocation, Removal and Miscellaneous
(PIRRM) pricing schedule, and the PWS states &quot;When an item is required to complete a work
order which is not prepriced within the PIRRM Schedule, the Government shall require at least
two (2), preferably (3) three, quotes of the non-prepriced items [over the micro-purchases level]
for review.&quot; KST, internally, applies this requirement for ALL non-prepriced items, giving the
Holloman customers the best value.</div>
              <br>
              <div><h4 style="display: inline;">Management:</h4> Ka&#39;ala Systems Technology (KST) site lead and corporate office have
established excellent dialogue with 49th Communications Squadron commissioned and
noncommissioned officers, which has resulted in great service to HAFB personnel based on 49th
CS and 49th WG priorities. The PWS requires the COR and BTS Manager meet up to five (5)
local meetings per month to better gauge work order requirements and ensure current work
orders are in-line with base efforts, but KST goes above-and- beyond on and have made
themselves available 24 hours per day, 365 days a year not only for the work orders, but also for
emergencies, outages, alerts, and exercises with zero issues. For instance, during this reporting
period KST worked closely with 49th AMXS and the 49th OG to schedule personnel to work
during weekends in a non-emergency situation for new requirements to the GDT towers. Due to
the nature of the work area and not being required to do so, KST adjusted their schedule to meet

the customer and base needs to work in non-flying impacted times, while still meeting all PWS
requirements for regular 0730-1630 M-F work orders.</div>
              <br>
              <div><h4 style="display: inline;">Regulatory Compliance:</h4> Ka&#39;ala Systems Technology (KST) has met all contractual
requirements in a satisfactory manner. KST was in compliance with their quality control plan
(QCP) ensuring all completed work orders met standards, installation practices and industry
standards. KST followed all Holloman AFB, city, county, state environmental
regulations/standards and safety requirements. KST met all state of New Mexico labor laws, and
tax laws.</div>
              <br>
              <h3>As the Contracting Officer, I concur with the COR&#39;s assessment above.</h3>
              <br>
              <h3>Reccomendation:</h3>Given what I know today about the contractor&#39;s ability to perform in accordance with this
contract or order&#39;s most significant requirements, I would recommend them for similar
requirements in the future.
