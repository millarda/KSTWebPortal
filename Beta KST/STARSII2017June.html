              <p>&emsp;Ka’ala Systems Technology (KST) Corp. was awarded the Prime contractor for 8(a) STARS II for Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).

            &emsp;STARS II enables federal agencies to fulfill mission requirements and, at the same time, assists in meeting or exceeding socioeconomic goals through the utilization of businesses which were certified 8(a) eligible by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Federal agencies may earn 8(a) credit and other applicable socioeconomic procurement preference credits1 that each industry partner possesses. These socioeconomic designations are indicated on the STARS II industry partner list on the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/8astars2">STARS II website</a>.

            <br>
            <br>
&emsp;STARS II supports direct award task orders under the $4 Million competitive threshold on a sole-source basis.  When requirements exceed the $4 Million contract holders must compete.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;The 8(a) STARS II functional areas correspond to four North American Industry Codes (NAICS). For each FA, the work examples in the bulleted list under each NAICS code description are representative, not all inclusive.
